* Figure out the right command to add to dotfiles main README for cloning this.

  Done? Current command has some weirdness, not sure if I want to debug it.

* What to do with ranger? Probably delete it for now, add it back if pipx is a problem?
  Pipx command:

  ```
  pipx install  'ranger-fm @ https://github.com/ranger/ranger/archive/refs/heads/master.zip'
  ```
